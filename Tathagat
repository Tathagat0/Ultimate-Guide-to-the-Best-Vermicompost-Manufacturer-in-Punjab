What is Vermicompost?
Vermicompost is a type of organic manure produced through the process of composting using various species of worms, usually red wigglers, white worms, and other earthworms. These worms consume organic waste materials, and their digestive process produces a nutrient-rich organic fertilizer known as vermicompost.

Benefits of Vermicompost
Enhanced Soil Fertility: Vermicompost improves soil structure, aeration, and water retention, leading to better root growth and plant health.
Rich in Nutrients: It contains essential nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients, which are readily available for plant uptake.
Promotes Microbial Activity: The presence of beneficial microorganisms in vermicompost enhances soil fertility and helps in disease suppression.
Eco-Friendly: Vermicompost production recycles organic waste, reducing landfill use and mitigating environmental pollution.
